Babbel was among the first to pioneer online language learning, creating a powerful app that combines communicative didactics, cognitivism, behaviorism and constructivism. Progressive lessons are connected together as an interlinking framework, with each step building towards the next. This guarantees learners the shortest path to real-life conversations by:

- Immersing you in a new language through real-life dialogues that get you speaking right away
- Building each course based on your native language and personal interests
- Employing proven cognitive techniques that move new vocab to your long-term memory
- Using human voices and speech recognition to get you speaking confidently
