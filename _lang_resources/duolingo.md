Duolingo is the most popular language-learning platform and the most downloaded education app in the world, with more than 300 million users. The companyâ€™s mission is to make education free, fun and accessible to all. Duolingo is designed to feel like a game and scientifically proven to be effective. In addition to its core platform, the company created the Duolingo English Test (DET), an affordable and convenient language certification option that is accepted by over 200 universities. Duolingo expanded beyond language learning with Tinycards, a reinvention of flashcards designed to make studying fun. The company has raised more than $108 million in venture capital from investors including Google Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, Union Square Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Drive Capital, Ashton Kutcher and Tim Ferriss.
